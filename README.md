# CVR-Mods

This repository does not yet officially exist, since CVR devs are figuring out what kinda rules they want for modding.
Do not use these mods if you aren't prepared to get punished, since I provide no warranty for these mods.
Generally though, I will not be making anything malicious, so hopefully the CVR devs won't care too much.

## Mod list

### KeyRebinder

A mod to allow for some keyboard rebinds.
Currently only supports rebinding the Mic key. And by rebinding I mean adding an additional button for it.
Because the keybinds seem to be hardcoded into one function, it's a bit difficult to do unbinds.

### SpoofHWID

A non-IL2CPP Unity BepInEx mod to spoof the HWID.
